# Programming Quotes

This is a random Programming Quote generator built using React. By pressing the button 'Get Quote' a third-party API is queried and then retrieved the quote and respective author. In addition, it is possible to share each quote on Twitter by clicking the respective button.

I developed this project in my spare time. The main goal was to develop and practice my skills with React, Javascript, JSX and fetching API resources with AXIOS.

### Getting the project running locally

```
git clone https://github.com/pedrotrigomiranda/programming-quotes.git

cd programming-quotes

npm install

npm run start

```

This will start a local server on `http://localhost:3000` that you can open in your web
browser.
